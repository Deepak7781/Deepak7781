# Hi there, I'm Deepak! 👋

🎓 **Aeronautical Engineering Student**  
*Passionate about turning the skies into playgrounds through flight simulation, robust control systems, and innovative aerodynamics.*  
I thrive on bridging theory and practice—whether it's crafting Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion controllers to tame unstable flight regimes or coding numerical solvers that make complex PDEs bow to computation. Let's launch some ideas together!

## ✈️ About Me
- **Simulation :** From dissecting F-16 stability modes to simulating hypersonic reentries, I geek out over what makes flight *feel* right.  
- **Creator at Heart:** Love hacking together Simulink models for quadcopter swarms or Python scripts for trajectory optimization—collaboration is my fuel.  
- **Control:** Avid reader of *Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems*, weekend hiker (plotting parabolic trajectories, naturally), and aspiring drone racer.  
- **Mission:** Democratize aero engineering tools so anyone can dream bigger and fly higher.  

*Open to internships in flight controls, UAV R&D, or aero simulation. Let's connect—coffee (virtual or real) on hypersonics? ☕*
